# CSE 341
This repository is based on my week 05-08 personal project on Web Services (CSE 341), I used Node.js to create this simple API at Brigham Young University - Idaho

## Yea, Pretty Cool Course
---
I learned much about Node.js, I used node packages to develop API's easily and i implemented what i learned pretty well, it was challenging but exciting.
